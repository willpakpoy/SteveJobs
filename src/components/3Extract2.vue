      The introduction of the iPod was the pinnacle of Jobs’ return to Apple in
      the late 90’s and cemented the company’s success for many years to come.
      At the time, the concept of a portable digital media player was not new,
      but after the introduction of the iTunes in 2001 Jobs realised they lacked
      something extremely important: simplicity. The lack of simplicity made
      these devices very inaccessible to the average consumer; and lacked
      marketing to go along with it. These two concepts; bringing the consumer
      to the center of the experience, and carefully choosing markets which
      lacked products that a consumer would actually want to buy, are two
      talents of Jobs that Isaacson touches on as being the driving force for
      Apple’s success in the early 2000’s when they began to branch away from
      only manufacturing desktop computers.

      Isaacson has managed to convey these notions about the way Jobs and his
      team imagineered (portmanteau of imagine and engineer, trademarked by
      Disney, before Jobs’ death he was the largest single shareholder of
      Disney) products by including simple anecdotes that help convey these core
      values of Jobs. For example, the anecdote at the start of the chapter
      about the company retreat in which Jobs chose 100 people “on a simple
      guideline: these were the hundred people you choose to take on a lifeboat
      to your next company” <span class="itr">(Isaacson 2011, 348)</span>. At
      this retreat, Jobs asked the chosen 100 people to come up with the “10
      things we should be doing next”. He would go on to cut the bottom 7 and
      say that “we could only choose three”. Cutting out the ideas Jobs didn’t
      see as useful helped the company devote resources to what they thought
      would be ground-breaking. A similar story of Jobs’ knack for simplicity
      was when he returned to Apple in the 90’s and how he transformed their
      confusing product line into a simple grid; a laptop and a desktop for a
      power user and an average consumer.
