  <extract title="The Reality Distortion Field">
    <p>
      In Chapter Eleven of <i>Steve Jobs</i>, Walter Isaacson interviews
      employees at Apple to understand what it was like to work in the original
      <i>Macintosh</i> team, headed by Jobs. Isaacson gives us an insight into
      the culture and of said team, and what many employees describe as Jobs’
      “reality distortion field” <span class="itr">(Isaacson 2011, p107)</span>,
      a term coined from an episode of Star Trek. This analogy is used to
      describe Jobs’ “eagerness to bend the fact to fit any purpose at hand“
      <span class="itr">(Isaacson 2011, p108)</span>; how he somehow manages to
      make the seemingly impossible not only completely possible, but positively
      amazing. Isaacson attributes a lot of Job’s success to this non-existent
      and unrealistic perceived sense of time, making reference to it many times
      throughout the biography. This, coupled with Jobs’ fierce attitude and
      clear passion for his products and the role they play in the life of the
      consumer is what helped push Apple to where it is today.

      Isaacson has also used hyperbole in this extract, solely to demonstrate
      how Jobs’ had a reputation for dire exaggeration, and how he had a very
      “binary” view on the world. “[People were either] enlightened[, or an]
      asshole” <span class="itr">(Isaacson 2011, p109)</span>, a foundation
      Macintosh team member was quoted as saying. The inclusion of these two
      mannerisms define a character for Jobs which helps the reader understand
      the context for other parts of his life story, especially his firing from
      Apple, the company he founded, in the 80’s and the reasons why he
      ultimately returned in the late-90’s.
